# Our_project  
This project provides source code that can be uploaded to M5 Stack atom matrix. The project is divided into 3 sub-projects: Brakelight, Temperature and Spinner-Dice game. 

### Brakelight - 

On uploading the source code on the M5 atom matrix, The M5 atom matrix can be imagined as a brake light that switches through 4 mode when button is pressed. 
1. OFF: Initially all leds are turned off.
2. Manual Rear strobe : On button pressed, Red LEDs strobe at a predetermined interval
3. Manual Front strobe :On button pressed for the second time, White LEDs strobe at a predetermined interval
4. Automatic Rear Mode Rear: On button pressed for the third time, LEDs are solid and red during a braking event. Return to strobe when riding.
5. Automatic Front Mode Rear: On button pressed for the fourth time, LEDs are solid and white during a braking event. Return to strobe when riding. 

On button pressed, the M5 atom cycles back to 

### Temperature - 

On uploading the source code on the M5 atom matrix, The M5 atom matrix can be imagined as a device that is carried by a person whole day. When holding the device in the hand with the screen facing relatively upwards, and pressing the button, the m5 atom is activated/ turned on. The modes on which the atom device is can be changed by tilting it right or left (right to increase the mode number, left to go back to the decrese the mode number.)

Modes:
i. Show Active temperature + Units
ii. Show average of last 24 hours of temperature + Units
iii. Show color scale of temperature range + current temperature as color
iv. Show graph of temperature across a predefined range.
v. Change units
